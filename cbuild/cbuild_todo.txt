Fixed	Description
[ ] 	Exclusions for Headers, Sources, Objects
[ ]	a task with a modified dependency (linked statically) is not rebuilt (need library checksum in cache)
[ ]	Add header files to cache, plus relevant rebuilding rules (what about shared headers across tasks??)
[ ]	Enable per-task source-globbing, for those projects with custom files in places
[ ]	linking failure does not attempt to rebuild the task
